It was bought during the First World  War in a little general store in  Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought  by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge  the day he set sail for Paris. It  was your great-granddaddy's war watch,  made by the first company to ever  make wrist watches. You see, up until  then, people just carried pocket  watches. Your great-granddaddy wore  that watch every day he was in the  war. Then when he had done his duty,  he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his  wrist and put it in an ol' coffee  can. And in that can it stayed 'til  your grandfather Dane Coolidge was  called upon by his country to go  overseas and fight the Germans once  again. This time they called it World  War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave  it to your granddad for good luck.  Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as  good as his old man's. Your granddad  was a Marine and he was killed with  all the other Marines at the battle  of Wake Island. Your granddad was  facing death and he knew it. None of  those boys had any illusions about  ever leavin' that island alive. So  three days before the Japanese took  the island, your 22-year old  grandfather asked a gunner on an Air  Force transport named Winocki, a man  he had never met before in his life,  to deliver to his infant son, who he  had never seen in the flesh, his  gold watch. Three days later, your  grandfather was dead. But Winocki  kept his word. After the war was  over, he paid a visit to your  grandmother, delivering to your infant  father, his Dad's gold watch. This  watch. This watch was on your Daddy's  wrist when he was shot down over  Hanoi. He was captured and put in a  Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew  if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd  be confiscated. The way your Daddy  looked at it, that watch was your  birthright. And he'd be damned if  and slopeheads were gonna put their  greasy yella hands on his boy's  birthright. So he hid it in the one  place he knew he could hide somethin'.  His ass. Five long years, he wore  this watch up his ass. Then when he  died of dysentery, he gave me the  watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk  of metal up my ass for two years.
