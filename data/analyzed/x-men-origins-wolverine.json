Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time. Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a hard-charging engine. An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but the car comes straight at him. The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to spare.

He grabs Gilman's collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground, prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist.
